The Air Force 1 was created by designer Bruce Kilgore and was the first basketball shoe to use the Nike Air technology. The shoe is offered in low, mid and high-top styles. Go crazy colourful or keep it monochromatic with 12 colours inspired by classic Air Force 1s and the athletes who made them popular. Add up to 3 characters on the heelâ€”you can even mix it up with different messages on the left and the right.

<h2>Adidas Stan Smith x Lego</h2>

<p><font size="4"> Adidas' Stan Smith sneakers have transcended time and style. They were born as a tennis shoe in the '60s but have since evolved to become more of a fashion silhouette. The minimalist look here is strong, and they work because of that understated simplicity. </font></p>
